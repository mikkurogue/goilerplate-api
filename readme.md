# Goilerplate - Powered by echo

The boilerplate for your Go API!

## Why?

Why not, its just a fun side project for me on the side. It's ease of access too for anyone wanting to get started with a boilerplate for an api.


## How to run?

Clone the repository and simply navigate to it with your terminal and fire the command `go run main.go`
To build the binaries run `go build .`

Then make a call to `localhost:1337/hello-world` to get an initial GET response!
